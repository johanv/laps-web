# Lithnet LAPS Web App

The Lithnet LAPS Web App is an IIS application that allows you to manage access to local admin passwords that are managed by the [Microsoft Local Admin Password Solution (LAPS)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/mt227395.aspx)

It provides granular permissions, auditing, email alerting and rate-limited access to LAPS passwords stored in a directory and is compatible with OpenID Connect, WS-Federation (ADFS), and integrated windows authentication.

## Warning: This is a fork!

I forked this from [the original](https://github.com/lithnet/laps-web). I introduced interfaces and dependency injection, which allows you to use different ways of authorization. You can choose a way of authorizing in the Web.config-file of the web application; search that file for `<container> ` to see what it is about.

I also tried to move all active-directory-related stuff to a dedicated assembly, but that was more difficult than I thought it would be. The `Startup`-class still depends heavily on Active Directory and alike. Maybe I'll still fix this at some point in the future. Maybe I won't. :-)

## Features
### Web-based accesss to LAPS passwords
The LAPS web app provides a simple web-based and mobile-friendly interface for accessing local admin passwords. There's no need for admins to install custom software, or have access to AD administrative tools to access LAPS passwords. Simply provide the computer name, and if you have access, the password is shown.

LAPS Administrators also have the option of forcing an expiry time when a password is accessed. This ensures that the password is rotated after use.

### Audit success and failure event logs
All success and failure events are logged to the event log and a file. These can be easily shipped off to a SIEM for record keeping and further analysis and reporting.

### Rate limiting
To prevent mass enumeration of passwords, you can limit the number of passwords an IP address or user can access within a given period.

### Modern authentication options
The web app supports traditional integrated windows authentication, as well as external authentication providers such as [ADFS](https://github.com/lithnet/laps-web/wiki/Setting-up-authentication-with-Active-Directory-Federation-Services) or 3rd party OpenID Connect providers such as [Azure AD](https://github.com/lithnet/laps-web/wiki/Setting-up-authentication-with-Azure-Active-Directory) and [Okta](https://github.com/lithnet/laps-web/wiki/Setting-up-authentication-with-Okta). Using an external authentication provider allows you the option of providing additional protections for the application such as multifactor authentication.
